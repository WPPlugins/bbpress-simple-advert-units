Insert advert units (such as adsense or Amazon widgets) into your bbpress forum. The plugin allows you to display advertising code between posts in
bbpress forum threads.  Optionally hide the adverts from your signed in regular users. Tested with bbPress 2.2.4

== Description ==

Insert advert units in to your bbpress forum.  You can use any sensible ad code you like assuming it fits into your forum's theme.  The plugin is particularly suited to showing Google Adsense units.

Adverts can be injected into various parts of the forum:

* Between posts
* In the body of the first post
* At the top and bottom of topic pages
* On individual forum pages
* On the top level forum page

== Installation ==
Upload and install the plugin as normal.  To get going, follow these instructions:

* Open the options menu Forum->Ad Units
* Paste in your ad code
* Choose whether the adds should be hidden from logged in users.

Thanks to PippinsPlugins for helping me to get started.

Note:  your ad provider may have rules about acceptable ad placement, it is your responsability to ensure you operate within their terms.
